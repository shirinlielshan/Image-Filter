# Image Filters

Image Filters is a Java application that allows you to apply various filters and effects to images. You can perform operations such as monochrome, channel swapping, blur, and gradient overlays. This project includes a graphical user interface for ease of use.

## Features

- Monochrome filter: Converts the image to grayscale.
- Channel swapping: Swaps the color channels (RGB, RBG, GRB, GBR, BGR, BRG).
- Blur effect: Applies a blur effect to the image.
- Gradient overlays: Adds horizontal and diagonal gradient overlays to the image.
